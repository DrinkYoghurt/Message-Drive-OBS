      "text": "Hello Arc! I hope you are feeling wonderful. Congratulations on your affiliate anniversary! I'm glad I got to meet you on that \"divorce\" stream, though it'd be awesome to find you even earlier! This anniversary reminds me that I missed almost a year of your streams. \n\n\nYou are awesome Arc, don't let the voices in your head fool you! You are funny, you are sincere, you are lovely. I'll do my best to keep reminding you all these but if you are ever feeling down with no bitlings around you, remember that we all appreciate you. We appreciate that you do your best to spend time with us, we appreciate that you try your best to stream. We all know it doesn't always work out and that's okay, we understand. We will be here, waiting for you, don't even worry about it! Just make sure you are taking care of yourself.\n\n\nI don't know if it means anything but, we are all proud of you! I can't wait to watch you celebrate more and more anniversaries, let's keep stacking them!",
