I'm glad I got to meet you on that \"divorce\" stream, though it'd be awesome to find you even earlier! This anniversary reminds me that I missed almost a year of your streams. You are awesome Arc, don't let the voices in your head fool you! You are funny, you are sincere, you are lovely. I'll do my best to keep reminding you all these but if you are ever feeling down with no bitlings around you, remember that we all appreciate you. We appreciate that you do your best to spend time with us, we appreciate that you try your best to stream. We all know it doesn't always work out and that's okay, we understand. We will be here, waiting for you, don't even worry about it! Just make sure you are taking care of yourself. I don't know if it means anything but, we are all proud of you! I can't wait to watch you celebrate more and more anniversaries, let's keep stacking them!",

It's such a pleasant place to simply exist for a while without worrying about everything else going on in life. Your personality, vibe, and voice create this perfect mix of comfort and fun - It's so easy to just sit back and enjoy the moment whenever your stream is on; You have a welcoming presence that's hard to put into words, so I hope turning you into a literal cat conveys it better :3 Thanks for creating a space that feels so easy to return to, and so comfortable just to be in.

My first day finding out about you was one of the best days I've experienced, you were so funny and welcoming, I felt at home and you almost instantly became one of my oshis. You've always interacted with as many people as you can, you never make anybody feel left out, and you're one of the sweetest streamers on the platform! You truly have no idea just how much you're loved and how much we as a community care for you. You've built a home with tons of friends! We'll always be grateful for you with all you do. Surviving through the hard times, coming back stronger, and wearing a smile upon your face. You're an inspiration, a hero, and a friend to a lot of people. To me, specifically, you may not be a perfect individual, but that's what I love about you (no parasocial tho :3) You're caring, you're sweet, you have a heart of gold, and you deserve all the best things in life. You had helped me, made my days brighter when they were dim, never failed to make me laugh or smile, and you have true talent. The fact you've come so far is beautiful and something you should be extremely proud of, just like how we all are! We're so proud of you and your work!! Please never give up, keep pushing forward, reach your goals, and continue being you! Because we love you for who you are",

I may still be a fairly new Bitling, but I must admit I really enjoy being in this community you've built, even as lurker who mostly stays in the walls!

You're such an amazing person to talk to <insert Arc heart emote> you're cute, silly, kind, and just have this thing that makes everyone around you feel way better. And don't forget the clicky noises of the keyboard THEY ARE THE BEST, just like your voice when you speak and sing. Whether I'm having a rough day or just bing chilling, talking with you and the community always makes everything better. Time flies way too fast when I'm around you and chat. Thank you for being so kind, funny, and caring you make everyone feel seen and appreciated. I'm so glad I can be here and love every second of being with chat and watching you play, draw, chat, or rage over things. Thank you, Arc, for being in our lives. You seriously deserve all the love and good things coming your way. Arc is cute, adorable, caring, kind, loving, wholesome, comforting, chaotic (sometimes), funny, cozy, silly â€” and don't forget OUR PRECIOUS BEAN. Mhm, pass it on.

Thank you for the community days you've arranged, which were very chaotic, but very fun in the end. The world needs more people like you, you're one of the kindest and sweetest people I have ever met in my life. You always look out for other people and you ALWAYS cheer them up if they are down. You are a very welcoming person that could make any person smile. It's always fun to tune it to your streams, even if I don't chat often. Truly has been a wonderful year with you. I hope you're having a great day today, smiling and having fun, cause you deserve it all, for all of the trouble and work you've gone through to give us absolute PEAK streams every time, and to whoever says otherwise I say OFF WITH HIS HEAD. You've survived streaming for a year and I sure as hell hope you'll continue streaming. I wish you best of luck with your streams and your career as a VTuber, and I am looking forward for your future streams. Always remember that you ArCANthabyte (sorry, had to add a pun) do anything, as long as you never give up! I am really thankful for everything you've done for us, and I hope you understand how much your effort means to us. Please don't stop being yourself because you are WONDERFUL.

From the small moments to the late night laughs, the scuffed tech issues (that happen in almost every stream), the inside jokes, to the big moments like building a whole community (raiding Matara Kan) and finding real friendships through what you love and I am so thankful for these friendships especially Yuki, the bond you two have is amazing and I love the energy the OG pussy pals give. I've seen all of your sides to streaming and I've loved every single second. ðŸ’— You've built something incredible, not just online but in the hearts of everyone who watches you. You bring joy, laughter, and comfort to so many people and I'm beyond proud to stand beside you through it all and continue to be your biggest supporter ever! Through the good days, the tough ones, the wins, and the L's!

Id trade a million just to see the Live notification another time. I look up to you now, more literally so when you're streaming from your penthouse in a few years. I Wish You Success. An Arc stream a day takes the sad away, though even Joy needs time to breath. For all of our sakes aswell, don't be afraid to turn on Sleep mode more often. I Wish You Health. Tried to write a book for all the reasons to watch Arc, Unfortunately there wasn't enough paper on earth.. Switched to digital, now I need another NAS. while this community is still just a small little corner of the internet.. its MY CORNER, I LIKE IT, I FEEL SAFE AND LAUGH CONSTANTLY. >:) As my extrEMELY, limited creative battery runs dry, ill end it here, I'll sleep soundly, knowing you'll be right there once I power back on.
