From the small moments to the late night laughs, the scuffed tech issues (that happen in almost every stream), the inside jokes, to the big moments like building a whole community (raiding Matara Kan) and finding real friendships through what you love and I am so thankful for these friendships especially Yuki, the bond you two have is amazing and I love the energy the OG pussy pals give. I've seen all of your sides to streaming and I've loved every single second. ðŸ’— You've built something incredible, not just online but in the hearts of everyone who watches you. You bring joy, laughter, and comfort to so many people and I'm beyond proud to stand beside you through it all and continue to be your biggest supporter ever! Through the good days, the tough ones, the wins, and the L's! I'll always be here, cheering for you louder than anyone else. ðŸŽ®ðŸ’ž Here's to more streams, more dreams, more laughter, and another year of doing life (and this crazy adventure) together.

I Wish You Success.\n\nAn Arc stream a day takes the sad away, though even Joy needs time to breath. For all of our sakes aswell, don't be afraid to turn on Sleep mode more often. I Wish You Health.\n\nTried to write a book for all the reasons to watch Arc, Unfortunately there wasn't enough paper on earth.. Switched to digital, now I need another NAS.\n\nwhile still this community is still just a small little corner of the internet.. its MY CORNER, I LIKE IT, I FEEL SAFE AND LAUGH CONSTANTLY. >:)\n\nAs my extrEMELY, limited creative battery runs dry, ill end it here, I'll sleep soundly, knowing you'll be right there once I power back on.\n\nTo another year of cringe moments, laughs, and nuclear fallout, and then a 100 years more.\nCheers!",

I want to just say how genuinely incredible it has been to be a part of this community, with a streamer like you, Arc. You are one of the greatest people IÂ´ve met in my entire life, and I donÂ´t even want to imagine where IÂ´d be in life if not for you and everyone else. I can only wish that you have the best life possible, no matter what, because throughout all of my time knowing you, I learned that you deserve absolutely nothing less.
