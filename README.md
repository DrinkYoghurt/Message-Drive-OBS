2. Click **▶ EJECT MESSAGE** to display a random message
3. **Press ESC** or click **[CLOSE]** to dismiss the message
4. Click the **🔓 lock icon** to unlock the drive for repositioning
5. **Drag the drive** anywhere on screen when unlocked
6. Click the **🔒 lock icon** again to lock position

#### During Stream:
- Messages pop up in a full-screen modal with the Matrix aesthetic
- Each message shows only once until all are exhausted
- When all messages are shown, the button changes to **↻ RESET & EJECT**
- Click reset to reload all messages and start fresh

---

### 4️⃣ Customizing Messages

Open `active_messages.json` in any text editor:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "Your custom message here!\n\nMultiple lines work too!",
      "author": "USERNAME"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Another message",
      "author": "ANOTHER_USER"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Message Format:
- **`id`** - Unique number for each message
- **`text`** - The message content (supports line breaks with `\n`)
- **`author`** - Who sent the message (displayed as "FROM: AUTHOR")

#### Important Notes:
- Keep the JSON structure valid (commas between objects, proper brackets)
- The overlay **auto-detects** when you save changes to the file
- Messages are automatically wrapped and scrollable if they're long
- Use `\n` for line breaks in your text

---

### 5️⃣ Switching Message Files

Want to use different message sets? Simply rename your files:

**For anniversary messages:**
```
active_messages.json (currently loaded)
```

**To switch to other messages:**
1. Rename current: `active_messages.json` → `active_messages_backup.json`
2. Rename desired: `inactive_messages.json` → `active_messages.json`
3. Refresh the browser source in OBS

The overlay always loads from `active_messages.json` by default.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't find the download button on GitHub?
- **Look for the green `<> Code` button** near the top of the page
- It's usually on the right side, above the file list
- Click it and select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu
- If you still can't find it, ask someone to send you the direct download link

### "⚠ FALLBACK MODE" appears
- **Cause:** `active_messages.json` not found or invalid
- **Solution:** 
  - Verify the JSON file is in the same folder as the HTML file
  - Check JSON syntax is valid (use [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/))
  - Make sure the file is named exactly `active_messages.json`

### Messages don't load after editing JSON
- **Solution:** 
  - Right-click Browser Source → **Refresh**
  - Or delete and re-add the browser source
  - Check console logs (Interact → F12 Developer Tools)

### Drive position resets after OBS restart
- **Cause:** LocalStorage not persisting (rare)
- **Solution:** 
  - Unlock and reposition the drive
  - OBS should save the position automatically
  - Check OBS isn't in "Safe Mode"

### Text is cut off or overflowing
- ✅ **This should be fixed!** The latest version properly wraps and scrolls all text
- If it still happens, refresh the browser source

### Can't click the drive or buttons
- Make sure you're in **Interact** mode (right-click source → Interact)
- Check that no other sources are overlapping the buttons

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Position Before Going Live** - Unlock, drag to your preferred spot, then lock it
2. **Test Your Messages** - Eject a few messages before stream to verify formatting
3. **Keep Backups** - Save copies of your message files before editing
4. **Use Line Breaks** - Add `\n` in your JSON for paragraph separation
5. **Author Names** - Keep them short (under 20 chars) for best display
6. **Message Length** - Any length works now! Long messages scroll automatically
7. **Multiple Files** - Keep different JSON files for different occasions
