## Step 5: Add Your Own Messages (Optional)

Want to add your own messages? Easy!

1. Find the `active_messages.json` file (or move the active_messages.json to the folder **messages** and make a new .json file)
2. **Right-click** on it
3. Choose **"Open with"** ‚Üí **"Notepad"** (Windows) or **"TextEdit"** (Mac)

You'll see something like this:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "Your message here!",
      "author": "USERNAME"
    }
  ]
}
```

### To add a new message:

1. Copy one of the message blocks (everything between `{` and `}`)
2. Paste it below, **add a comma** after the previous message
3. Change the `id` number (make it unique)
4. Change the `text` to your message
5. Change the `author` to who sent it
6. **Save the file**

**Example:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "arc is cute mhm pass it on",
      "author": "everyone"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "don't say: no you",
      "author": "everyone"
    }
  ]
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** 
- Add commas between messages (but NOT after the last one!)
- Keep all the `{` `}` `[` `]` brackets
- Use straight quotes `"` not curly quotes `"`

### Updating messages in OBS:

After you save changes:
1. Right-click the source in OBS
2. Click **"Refresh"**

Your new messages will load automatically!
